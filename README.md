# Lab2
In this lab, I will create a solution that contains a class library,
and a console application. In the library, you must create classes for different geometrics
figures as described below. Then you should use the console application for
to create objects and make calculations

Create a project in the same solution that uses your class library
This project will create an array of 20 random shapes, by calling
generateShape(). Then loop through the array and print all the shapes again, in the the console.
Simultaneously calculate the average area of all Shapes in the array,
Present this nice and clear on the console when the loop is complete
